# My Personal Website!
Welcome! This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, live at  https://jb-cheng.github.io/.  

## Inspiration
The visual design and aesthetic of this website are inspired by a storyline from the game Arknights, specifically the "Lone Trail" event.
